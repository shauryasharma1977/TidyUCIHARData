# TidyUCIHARData
This is Shaurya Sharma's project submission to Collect, and clean a the UCI HAR data set. It contains code and instructions to analyze the Human activity recognition dataset.

The goal is to prepare tidy data which can be used for further analysis. 

Dataset

Files
1. CodeBook.md provides structure of the code describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

2. run_analysis.R contains all the code to address the the requirements of the assignment.
    a) Downloads the data
    b) Creates one tidy dataset of all the data
    c) Replace the activity code in the data set with descriptive activity names
    d) Change variable names of the dataset to be descriptive and human readable
    e) Create a new dataset with calculates the mean of all variables

3. FinalAveragesData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
